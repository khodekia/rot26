# ROT26 Encryption Algorithm  
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet.
Instead of only rotating 13 places, ROT26 rotates twice as many characters in the alphabet and is therefore twice as secure.

A pure C++ implementation of the legendary ROT26 algorithm!  

This implementation even supports ROT13 and *any* ROT configuration. Of course, friendly and helpful comments are included, but let's be honest—you're here for the true power of ROT26.  

ROT26 encryption and decryption are notoriously complex, often requiring a purpose-built supercomputer to handle the mind-bending calculations... but not anymore.  

Thanks to the incredible efforts of a certain creative genius, ROT26 has been de-rusted (pun intended) and made accessible to the masses by getting rusted. Crazy, right? It’s innovators like him that change the world for the better!
